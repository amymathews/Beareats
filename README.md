## Introduction

Beareats is a unique platform that aims to foster a sense of community among UC Berkeley students who are passionate about health and wellness. With Beareats, you can share your favorite recipes, explore new meal ideas, track your macros, and connect with friends who share similar health goals.

## Features

- **Social Meal Sharing:** Take a picture of your meal, list the ingredients, and write a short description. Beareats will calculate the nutritional information and display it alongside your post.

- **Nutritional Information:** Gain insights into the macro and micro nutrients of your meals. This feature helps you make informed dietary choices while engaging with the community.

- **Dark Mode Accessibility:** We've implemented a dark mode theme to enhance readability, reduce eye strain, and accommodate users with visual sensitivities.
